# Deploying Cloud Foundry on Google Compute Engine

This guide describes how to deploy a minimal [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/) on [Google Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/) using BOSH. The BOSH director must have been created following the steps in the [Deploy BOSH on Google Cloud Platform](../bosh/README.md) guide.

## Prerequisites

* You must have an existing BOSH director and bastion host created by following the [Deploy BOSH on Google Cloud Platform](../bosh/README.md) guide.

## Cost and resource requirements

* This CF deployment (and the BOSH director/bastion pre-requisite) is small enough to fit in a default project [Resource Quota](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/resource-quotas). It consumes:
    - 20 cores in a single region
    - 24 pre-emptible cores in a second region **during compilation only**
    - 2 IP addresses
    - 600 Gb persistent disk

You can view an estimate of the cost to run this deployment for an entire month at [this link](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=f543773c-1848-47fc-b302-6568b0f0db94).

## Deploy supporting infrastructure automatically

The following instructions use [Terraform](terraform.io) to provision all of the infrastructure required to run CloudFoundry.

### Steps to perform in `bosh-bastion`

1. SSH to the `bosh-bastion` VM. You can SSH form Cloud Shell or any workstation that has `gcloud` installed:

  ```
  gcloud compute ssh bosh-bastion
  ```

1. `cd` into the Cloud Foundry docs directory that you cloned when you created the BOSH bastion:

  ```
  cd /share/docs/cloudfoundry
  ```

1. Export a few vars to specify the location of compilation VMs:

  ```
  # You may be tempted to set these to the same value as your BOSH deployment (eg `us-east1`). 
  # However, this may cause you to exceed your regional quotas. 
  # By breaking apart the regions, you avoid this problem.

  export region_compilation=us-central1
  export zone_compilation=us-central1-b
  ```

1. View the Terraform execution plan to see the resources that will be created:

  ```
  terraform plan \
    -var network=${network} \
    -var projectid=${project_id} \
    -var region=${region} \
    -var region_compilation=${region_compilation} \
    -var zone=${zone} \
    -var zone_compilation=${zone_compilation}
  ```

1. Create the resources:

  ```
  terraform apply \
    -var network=${network} \
    -var projectid=${project_id} \
    -var region=${region} \
    -var region_compilation=${region_compilation} \
    -var zone=${zone} \
    -var zone_compilation=${zone_compilation}
  ```

1. Create a service account and key that will be used by Cloud Foundry VMs:

  ```
  gcloud iam service-accounts create cf-component
  ```

1. Grant the new service account editor access and logging access to your project:

  ```
  gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding ${project_id} \
      --member serviceAccount:cf-component@${project_id}.iam.gserviceaccount.com \
      --role "roles/editor" \
      --role "roles/logging.logWriter" \
      --role "roles/logging.configWriter"
  ```

1. Target and login into your BOSH environment:

  ```
  bosh target 10.0.0.6
  ```

  > **Note:** Your username is `admin` and password is `admin`.

1. Retrieve the outputs of your Terraform run to be used in your Cloud Foundry deployment:

  ```
  export vip=$(terraform output ip)
  export zone=$(terraform output zone)
  export zone_compilation=$(terraform output zone_compilation)
  export region=$(terraform output region)
  export region_compilation=$(terraform output region_compilation)
  export private_subnet=$(terraform output private_subnet)
  export compilation_subnet=$(terraform output compilation_subnet)
  export network=$(terraform output network)

  export director=$(bosh status --uuid)
  ```

1. Upload the stemcell:

  ```
  bosh upload stemcell https://bosh.io/d/stemcells/bosh-google-kvm-ubuntu-trusty-go_agent?v=3263.7
  ```

1. Upload the required [BOSH Releases](http://bosh.io/docs/release.html):

  ```
  bosh upload release https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-mysql-release?v=23
  bosh upload release https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/garden-linux-release?v=0.340.0
  bosh upload release https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/etcd-release?v=36
  bosh upload release https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/diego-release?v=0.1454.0
  bosh upload release https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-release?v=231
  ```

1. Target the deployment file and deploy:

  ```
  bosh deployment manifest.yml
  bosh deploy
  ```

Once deployed, you can target your Cloud Foundry environment using the [CF CLI](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/cf-cli/):

  ```
  cf api https://api.${vip}.xip.io --skip-ssl-validation
  cf login
  ```

Your username is `admin` and your password is `c1oudc0w`.

### Delete resources

From your `bosh-bastion` instance, delete your Cloud Foundry deployment:

  ```
  bosh delete deployment cf
  ```

Then delete the infrastructure you created with terraform:
  ```
  cd /share/docs/cloudfoundry
  terraform destroy \
    -var projectid=${project_id} \
    -var region=${region} \
    -var zone=${zone} \
    -var network=${network}
  ```

**Important:** The BOSH bastion and director you created must also be destroyed. Follow the **Delete resources** instructions in the [Deploy BOSH on Google Cloud Platform](../bosh/README.md) guide.
